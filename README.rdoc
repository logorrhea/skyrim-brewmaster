== Skyrim Brewmaster

This is to be a web application that will allow users to experiment with different
combinations of ingredients from the popular RPG Skyrim.

Users will be able to save their favorite recipes, as well as get helpful information
about which recipes will yield the most bang for their buck.

== Tech Used

This application is essentially my toy assignment in learning the up-and-coming EmberJS
framework.
